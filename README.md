# application-development-directory-setup
This repository contains a script to create my personal directory setup
for web development, desktop application development, mobile application development and
other application development.

These contain specific project folders, an exercise folder, a scrapboard folder and a 
folder for unorganized files.

An example of the directory structure can be found in the [EXAMPLE.txt](EXAMPLE.txt) file.

I created this project because I want to learn more about shell scripting.
